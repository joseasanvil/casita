## A small house built using the Rolife DIY Miniature House Kit - Flower House controlled using an arduino nano

The arduino controlls the light bulb inside the house

It has two switches for controlling states:

One switch controlls ON/OFF behavior

The other switch is for changing state/behavior of light bulb

State 1: Always on

State 2: Blink LED

State 3: Dim LED on and off

State 4: Light the bulb as in a horror movie

State 5: Dim the light randomly to simulate a candle
